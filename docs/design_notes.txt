Design notes for Battleships project



22 June 2023 - diagram outline of skeleton code / files provided

I have diagrammed the outline and relationships between the files given in the original template code. Next I will look at the tests (there appears to be only one), viewing this as a specification, enabling me to see more clearly what the methods in the skeleton do. After understanding these I will come to the user stories and then test-driver further work from there.



22 June 2023 - make notes from the test file, treating it as a specification

Reviewing syntax for mocking in rspec, seeing extensive use of doubles in the RSpec tests. It appears to be using named arguments in method calls. Need to double-check syntax for that too. 

The test sets up io as a double identified by symbol :io and sets up game as a double identified as symbol :game which returns 10 for both row and cols methods.

It configures the io double to expect to receive a number of puts methods.

It configures the game to expect to receive unplaced_ships and return an array of doubles, both identified with symbol ship; one returning 2 for its length and one returning 5 for its length.

It expects a sequence of puts and gets, then place_ship, ship_at? and sequence of puts that display the board.

As the above specs are built using doubles, they give us a very clear idea of how the required methods need to behave. Next steps will be to develop them incrementally based on user stories, I expect, which I will look at next.



22 June 23 - checking README.md to choose user stories and test driver

Running the existing code, as-per the README, providing inputs the same as those given in the test code, results in a crash with the following message:

Welcome to the game!
Set up your ships first.
You have these ships remaining: 
Which do you wish to place?
2
Vertical or horizontal? [vh]
v
Which row?
3
Which column?
2
OK.
/home/ark/Documents/Coding/Makers/ruby/battleships/lib/game.rb:12:in `place_ship': wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 0) (ArgumentError)
        from /home/ark/Documents/Coding/Makers/ruby/battleships/lib/user_interface.rb:39:in `prompt_for_ship_placement'
        from /home/ark/Documents/Coding/Makers/ruby/battleships/lib/user_interface.rb:11:in `run'
        from run.rb:18:in `<main>'

It would appear that the place_ship method needs work. Will also consider the user stories and choose some work accordingly. These are:

As a player
So that I can prepare for the game
I would like to place a ship in a board location

As a player
So that I can play a more interesting game
I would like to have a range of ship sizes to choose from

As a player
So the game is more fun to play
I would like a nice command line interface that lets me enter ship positions and
shots using commands (rather than using IRB to interact with objects)

As a player
So that I can create a layout of ships to outwit my opponent
I would like to be able to choose the directions my ships face in

As a player
So that I can have a coherent game
I would like ships to be constrained to be on the board

As a player
So that I can have a coherent game
I would like ships to be constrained not to overlap

As a player
So that I can win the game
I would like to be able to fire at my opponent's board

As a player
So that I can refine my strategy
I would like to know when I have sunk an opponent's ship

As a player
So that I know when to finish playing
I would like to know when I have won or lost

As a player
So that I can consider my next shot
I would like to be able to see my hits and misses so far

As a player
So that I can play against a human opponent
I would like to play a two-player game


It's quite possible the above have been deliberately ordered for ease of implementation, especially as the first error when running the code appears to require the first user story to be implemented correctly. I will consider this first then and use an emergent design, which can be adapted gradually as we add to the code.



22 June 23 - working with this user story:

As a player
So that I can prepare for the game
I would like to place a ship in a board location

Running the program as it stands, I notice that initially it is not saying that there are any ships remaining, whereas the test is expecting 2,5 to be displayed. Perhaps the code needs to be combined with another user story..?

As a player
So that I can play a more interesting game
I would like to have a range of ship sizes to choose from

The above seems to fit, and so I may consider the two together.

Thoughts:
In the Game class, unplaced_ships method returns [] in the skeleton, perhaps add code to return an array that maybe is initialised to something else, testing gradually; then remove those items from the array as the user places them? We'd need a loop to check they're all placed eventually.

May experiment by creating a unit-test for Game class and test-driving it.

I have test-driven initialize method for Game class and used attr_reader for unplaced_ships.

Thoughts:
Considering the data structure for storing the ship when chosen for placement... Perhaps worth going back to test provided and gain ideas from that about the structure. May have to review how multi-dimensional arrays are done in Ruby.

Experimented in irb to check use of multi-dimensional arrays.

May try experimenting with a simple number scheme in a ten-by-ten array, initialised to all zeros. Will test drive next.



23 June 23 - continuing with these user stories:

As a player
So that I can prepare for the game
I would like to place a ship in a board location

As a player
So that I can play a more interesting game
I would like to have a range of ship sizes to choose from

In addressing the second of these first, I think I will take a cue from tests in skeleton code given, namely:

      expect(io).to receive(:puts).with("You have these ships remaining: 2, 5")
      expect(io).to receive(:puts).with("Which do you wish to place?")
      expect(io).to receive(:gets).and_return("2\n")
      
Perhaps we store an array of integers representing remaining ships, each integer being equal to the length of that ship.

Wrote and tested code for the above yesterday, passing the array to the constructor of game, as in:

  def initialize(ships_array)
    @unplaced_ships = ships_array
  end

Thoughts:
The game needs to have a board that it will manage, so probably sensible to set that up in the constructor for game. To unit-test game, will need to mock the instance of board.
Maybe some thought needs to be given to not returning a reference to the internal data structure of the board and it should be hidden behind access methods. This may be something to return to. 

Try refactoring game to inject dependency on board, to enable unit testing using mocks later.
Potentially use some setup code in rspec to initialise a board double when unit-testing game... Rechecking before and after hooks in rspec...

Having refactored game_spec to use mock Board, need to consider further the interface of Board... 
Looking at user_interface_spec, seems also need to consider place_ship method. This code is useful:

      expect(game).to receive(:place_ship).with({
        length: 2,
        orientation: :vertical,
        row: 3,
        col: 2
      })

Have setup some pseudo-code for place_ship ready to use mock board in game unit test, and test in board unit test.


04 July 23 - resuming project today
